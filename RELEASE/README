This directory has somewhat-battle-tested release configurations for the EPC. Currently, we assume the following:
1) The EPC is all-in-one, and exists on a physical device (i.e. a Zotac box), NOT a VM
2) The eNB is a completely separate physical/logical component that connects to the EPC via ethernet.
3) Right now we have only tested a 1-1 relationship between eNB and EPC.

Given these assumptions, choose an OS and follow the instructions given in {OS}/preconfig. Don't worry about {OS}/ansible, those scripts will be copied/installed automatically for you.

Generally speaking, these scripts setup the following configuration:
- username: enbrain
- password: password <==== CHANGE THIS!!!
- mysql user: enbrain
- mysql password: correcthorsebatterystaple
- After installation/reboot, run "/home/enbrain/setup_enbrain.sh" to complete the installation.
